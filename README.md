# python_text_search
Full Text Search Implementation  using Python 


Steps to run the  code :
I have run the code on Windows machine. The following steps are windows specific :
1)	Install python 2.7
2)	Use a suitable text editor (Pycharm, Sublime). 
3)	Mark your Python file as executable - On Windows, the standard Python installer already associates the .py extension with a file type (Python.File) and gives that file type an open command that runs the interpreter (C:\Python27\python.exe "%1"%*). This is enough to make scripts executable from the command prompt as ‘foo.py’.
4)	Add .py to the PATHEXT environment variable.
5)	Documents.csv and InvertedIndex.csv files will be created at “C:\Python27\” location.     
6)	Execute the commands as follows :
blazeindex add '{"id":"123","text":"We are going to build a HUUUUUGEEE wall"}' 
blazeindex query 'WALL'
